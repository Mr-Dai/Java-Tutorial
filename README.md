# Java-Tutorial

[Java Official Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) has always been an ideal study resource for Java newbie, but it comes in seperated blog-like web pages, most of which are actually too long to be finished in minutes. On the other hand, reading on monitor screen is tiring for some people (like me). In this case, a printable version of the tutorial is necessary.

## The Content of the Project

The printable version should come in two different format: zipped Markdown and LaTeX PDF. Source files of different topics can be found in their corresponding folders.
